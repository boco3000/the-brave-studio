## The goal

Build a modern marketing site that feels premium and loads fast. Priorities were clear hierarchy, tight typography, and reliable conversion paths.

## What I built

- A token-based design system (CSS variables)
- Reusable UI primitives (Button, Card, Motion)
- Accessible interaction patterns (focus-visible, keyboard support)
- Performance-minded layout and minimal motion

## Outcome

A clean, scalable foundation for adding more pages and content without losing consistency.
