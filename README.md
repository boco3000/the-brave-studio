## Overview

The Brave Studio is a fictional creative studio used as a case study for building
a sleek, modern marketing site. The goal was to simulate the type of website
freelance clients often need: clear positioning, strong hierarchy, and a
conversion-focused structure.

This project prioritizes:
- clarity over visual noise
- reusable components
- accessibility and performance
- clean, maintainable code

---

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **React + TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS v4**
- **Framer Motion** (motion with reduced-motion support)
- **CSS Variables** for design tokens
- Deployed on **Vercel**

---

## Key Features

- **Design system with tokens**  
  Centralized color, spacing, and radius variables for consistency and scalability.

- **Reusable UI primitives**  
  Buttons, containers, and motion helpers built for reuse across sections.

- **Structured marketing layout**  
  Hero → Services → Featured Work → Process, mirroring real client sites.

- **Accessible interactions**
  - Keyboard-friendly navigation
  - Focus-visible states
  - Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

- **Performance-minded UI**
  - Minimal animations
  - Clean layout hierarchy
  - No unnecessary client-side state

## Pages & Structure

- `/` — Marketing homepage
- `/work` — Work index (stub)
- `/work/[slug]` — Case study route (extensible)

The project is structured to scale into a full case-study system using MDX or a CMS.

## Why This Project Exists

This project was built to demonstrate:
- how I structure real client websites
- how I think about design systems and reuse
- how I balance polish with restraint
- how I write readable, refactorable code

It reflects how I approach freelance and contract work.
