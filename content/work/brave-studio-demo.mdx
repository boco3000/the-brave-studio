## Goal

Build a modern studio website that demonstrates real client-ready patterns:
- content-driven case studies (MDX)
- reusable UI primitives
- accessibility baseline (focus states, keyboard nav)
- production SEO (metadata, sitemap, robots, JSON-LD)

## What I built

- **Hero + service sections** with a sleek, high-contrast aesthetic
- **Work system** driven by MDX frontmatter (featured work on home, full list on /work)
- **Case study template** with navigation (Prev/Next) and progress indicator
- **Work filters** using URL query params (`?tag=` and `?q=`) for shareable browsing
- **Mobile nav drawer** with Escape close, focus management, and overlay

## Why this architecture

A studio site evolves. Instead of hardcoding content into components, the UI stays stable while case studies scale independently.

## Highlights

- Server components load content, client components handle interactivity
- SEO-ready routing with canonical URLs, Open Graph, and JSON-LD
- Clean design tokens with an electric-cyan accent
