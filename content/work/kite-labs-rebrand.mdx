## The goal

Create a sleek studio website that communicates credibility fast and feels intentional.

## What I built

- A consistent section system (Hero → Services → Work → Process)
- Card-driven layout patterns for reuse
- Motion that respects reduced-motion preferences

## Outcome

A professional structure that scales into a full portfolio with MDX-driven case studies.
